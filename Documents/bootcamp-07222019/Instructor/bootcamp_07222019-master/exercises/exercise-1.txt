- Pair up with a person and interview them. Please record their answers to the following questions:

1. What is your full name?

2. What is your role/team here at Intuit?

3. Where did you go to college/school/training?

4. What is your hometown? (this can be any city which you think of as your hometown)

5. Birth month and day? Please do not include year.

6. Someone who inspires you.

7. Three interesting things about yourself. 

8. A picture of yourself (from Intuit Insight, Google images, or another source)

The person being interviewed can skip any question they like, and all fake answers may be given for any question. You may only use information provided to you by the person.
